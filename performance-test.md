# AI Performance Optimizations Applied

## Changes Made:

1. **Disabled Updater Background Process** - The update checker was running on app start which could slow down initial load
   - Commented out the useEffect that calls `checkForUpdates()` on mount

2. **Increased Batch Size for Streaming** - Improved chunk processing performance
   - Changed BATCH_SIZE from 3 to 20 for fewer setState updates
   - This reduces React re-renders during AI streaming responses

3. **Disabled Debug Console Logs** - Removed performance-impacting logging
   - Commented out extensive console.log statements in AI processing flow
   - These logs were being called frequently during responses and slowing things down

4. **Optimized Content Processing** - Reduced logging overhead during:
   - OCR text extraction from images
   - PDF content preparation 
   - Notes content processing
   - User message enhancement logging

## Expected Performance Improvements:

- **Faster Initial Load**: No background update checking on startup
- **Faster AI Responses**: Batched updates reduce React re-renders 
- **Reduced CPU Usage**: Fewer console operations during streaming
- **Better Memory Usage**: Less string manipulation for debug output

## Test the Improvements:

1. Start the app: `npx tauri dev`
2. Open AI assistant and ask a question
3. Response should stream faster with less stuttering
4. Initial app load should be quicker

The app should now respond at the millisecond speeds you need for interviews.
